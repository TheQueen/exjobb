AUTHORS:
(insert name) was created by Ida Nyblad and Chrisina Ahrén for their bachelor thesis (Load Balancing Workloads Through DRAM Bank Partitioning) at Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 2018.


NOTES ON WHY TO USE (insert name):
(insert name) is a controller that uses palloc to partition the main memory/DRAM.
Itś goal is to ..., to decrese latency created by contention in the main memory.
(Insert name) is most effectivly used when there is a lot of contention in the main memory, i.e. there is one, or more processes that make a lot of main memory requests/are main memory intensive.
(insert name) can then be used to ensure speedy execution if a specific process, despite there being other memory intensive processes.


HOW TO RUN:

./(insert name) PID
//eller skulle vi göra bibliotek/funktion? Det skulle vi va?

Run the file and use the process ID (PID) of the process you want not to be effected by other memory intensive processes.


REMEMBER
install cgroup tools: sudo apt install cgroup-tools




WHAT (insert name) WILL DO FOR ME:
(insert name) will initialise PALLOC and set some standard partions based on the processs ID given as input.





MPLAYER: 
install mplayer: sudo apt install mplayer

get v: mplayer -benchmark -nosound -vo null space.mkv | grep -i 'V:' > FPStest.txt







HOW PALLOC IS INITIALISED:
The process ID given as input to (insert name) will be given (a partion) of PALLOC DRAM/main memory bins.
